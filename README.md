# Clean Movie Dataset
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to extract movie data from a scrape of Wikipedia and movie ratings data from MovieLens, clean the data and merge it into a single dataset, and then load the dataset into a SQL table. The Wikipedia scrape was provided in the form of a [wiki.json file](Resources/wikipedia-movies.json), and the MovieLens data was downloaded as a [zip file from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?titleType=dataset-downloads&showDatasetDownloadSkip=False&messageId=datasetsWelcome&returnUrl=%2Frounakbanik%2Fthe-movies-dataset%3Fresource%3Ddownload). In the [function test](ETL_function_test.ipynb), I created a function that would extract the data from the wiki.json and the kaggle files and add it to a dataframe. I then modified the function to [clean the wiki data](ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb) and [clean the kaggle data](ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb). Finally, I further modified the function to load the cleaned dataframe into a SQL database, as well as load the ratings.csv file from Kaggle to a SQL table because it was too large to upload to Github.
